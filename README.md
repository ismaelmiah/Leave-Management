## Overview
In many companies, Employee Leave Management systems can sometimes be taken into account retrospectively. Some use a paper-based system. Others mark the day in their calendars if they do so at all. This practice grows many issues, especially when asked from the employee’s point of view.

This system has the following features.
- Ability to apply for leave at any time of the day
- Employees can find out how many leaves are left
- It is easy to know whether his leave application was accepted or rejected
- The admin can easily find out how many leaves have been applied for
- The ability for the admin to allocate the leaves for all employees at once
- The admin can change the amount of leave of the employee
